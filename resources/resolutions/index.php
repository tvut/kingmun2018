                <h3>Every committee's goal is to pass a resolution that addresses the topic at hand.  As a delegate representing your country, it is your duty to insure that the passed resolution benefits your country.  If you are involved in writing a resolution, it is necessary that you negotiate and compromise with other delegates to produce a resolution that benefits their countries as well, as resolutions require a majority vote (50%) to pass.</h3>
                <h2>General Tips </h2>
                <h3>1. Keep your country in mind: Your resolution must fit the values and policies of your nation.  You are representing your country's beliefs, not your own.  </h3>
                <h3>2. Keep your allies in mind: In addition to helping your country, your resolution should not hurt or place excessive burden on any of your allies.  For example, if you are representing Canada, it would be unwise to suggest that the US singlehandedly fund a humanitarian effort, as this puts excessive financial burden on your ally. </h3>
                <h3>3. Beware of committee jurisdictions: Each committee has different jurisdictions determining what actions they have the authority to make.  For example, most UN bodies cannot enforce, they can only suggest, while the UN Security Council has the ability to make demands or deploy soldiers.  Check your committee’s background guide for your committee’s jurisdictions and make sure that your resolution only calls for actions within this jurisdiction. </h3>
                <h3>4. Be specific: Whenever possible, be as specific and comprehensive as possible in your resolution.  This could include setting a clear plan of action, explaining sources of funding, setting dates, and describing which countries are affected.   </h3>
                <h3>5. Be concise: With multiple sponsors working on the same resolution, it is likely that your resolution may develop redundancies or discontinuities.  Be sure to avoid repetitions and state your solutions in the simplest and clearest ways possible.</h3>
                <h2>Preambulatory Clauses </h2>
                <h3>Preambulatory clauses provide key background information about your resolution.  They explain the reasoning behind your resolution, both why it is necessary and why it is being implemented as it is.  These clauses directly apply research by citing facts or previous international action.</h3>
                <h3>Preambulatory clauses always begin with a preambulatory phrase, a participial phrase with your committee as the implied subject.  One simple example would be “recognizing the need for water wells in Africa to provide clean water in remote areas.”  This preambulatory clause means that your committee (for example, UNESCO), believes that water wells are a necessary solution to the current water crisis in Africa.  This gives more information about your resolution, providing the reasoning behind why you would presumably call for the building of water wells in your operative clauses.</h3>
                <h3>Preambulatory clauses are supposed to start broad and become increasingly more specific.  This helps direct the flow of your resolution.</h3>
                <h3>Preambulatory clauses do not exist simply to fill space! In general, they should serve one of the following functions: </h3>
                <h3>1. Divide the topic: In general, resolutions break a large issue into many small sub-issues and address each of these sub-issues with specific solutions.  Preambulatory clauses identify the different sub-issues at play.  You should have one or more operative clauses specifically addressing this identified sub-issue. </h3>
                <h3>2. Provide statistics: In order to justify or explain the reasoning behind your resolution, you can provide key statistics in preambulatory clauses.  However, make sure that these are specifically applicable to your particular resolution.  Be sure to say where these facts came from, and ensure that you are using a credible source, preferably a UN agency or partner. </h3>
                <h3>3. Cite past international action: It is important that you are aware of past international action so that your resolution does not simply repeat something that has already been done.  Cite past actions such regional efforts, government programs, or UN resolutions either to emphasize why those past actions did not work, or to explain why those solutions did work and thus why you will be implementing them on a larger/different scale.  </h3>
                <h3>4. Explain reasoning: Preambulatory clauses can explain the reasoning behind the solutions that you take in your operative clauses.  This could include citing instances where these solutions worked elsewhere, pointing out flaws in other alternatives, or simply explaining the reasoning behind a solution.</h3>
                <h2>Operative Clauses  </h2>
                <h3>Operative clauses provide the substantive meat of your resolution and explain what your committee will do to address the issue at hand.  These clauses appear in a numbered list, and usually are ordered from most important/most specific/most unique to most general.  It is also smart to cluster operative clauses around certain sub issues that you are addressing.  For example, if you have 4 clauses addressing the economic aspect of an issue, it may be logical to put these clauses one after another.</h3>
                <h3>In many cases, you may want to create sub-clauses to give more information about an operative clause.  Syntactically, be sure that your clause can be read smoothly no matter which sub-clause is read after the main clause.  See the example resolution below for an example of this.</h3>
                <h3>It is very important that the solutions proposed in your operative clauses fall under the jurisdiction of your committee.  Each committee has particular guidelines explaining what powers they have, and these vary vastly per committee.  Check your committee’s background guide for more details on your committee’s exact jurisdictions.</h3>
                <h3>Every solution that you present in your operative clauses should address ALL of the following: </h3>
                <h3>1. Who: Who will be implementing the solution?  Don’t just say “rich countries”, provide specific criteria such as “all countries with a GDP over…”  You can also include NGOs or even specific countries, but don’t simply pin everything on the United States.  </h3>
                <h3>2. What: What exactly does the plan hope to accomplish?  Be as specific as possible.  Generally, a plan will attempt to solve a sub-issue of the broader topic, not the entire issue itself.   </h3>
                <h3>3. When: When will the plan be put into place, and for how long will it run?  Under what circumstances will it be terminated? </h3>
                <h3>4. Where: Where will your plan be implemented?  Do not simply say “poor countries”, provide a specific criteria to determine exactly who/where your plan will be applied.  This could include listing out specific regions or countries.  </h3>
                <h3>5. Why: Why is your solution the best solution?  A lot of this should be done in your preambulatory clauses, but be sure to provide specific reasoning for each operative clause.   </h3>
                <h3>6. How: How specifically will your solution solve the issue?  Be as specific as possible. </h3>
                <h3>7. How Funded: Where will you gain the funding to pay for your solution?  Please note, NGOs are NOT a source of funding.  NGOs may be the actors implementing your solution, but NGOs are the ones who need money to do the job, not the ones gathering money.  Funding could come from the IMF, the budget for your committee, or requiring all members of your committee to donate a percentage of their GDP.</h3>
