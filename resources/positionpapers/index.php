                <h3>As a culmination of your researching process, you are strongly encourage to complete and turn in a position paper. The purpose of the position paper is to help you organize your research into a concise format such that you can easily access it during the conference. In addition, position papers allow you to begin brainstorming solutions to the issues at hand, which will provide you with a solid foundation for writing resolutions later on.</h3>
                <h3><b>To be eligible to win any award, you must turn in a complete position paper on time. If you do not turn in a complete position paper on time, you will be barred from winning any award, including non-research awards such as Best Delegate, Most Diplomatic, Best Speaker, etc.</b></h3>
                <h3>The delegate who submits the best position paper in each committee will win a Best Position Paper award. This award is determined before the conference even starts and does not take into account a delegates performance at the conference itself. Scoring for the best position paper award will be based upon the following criteria, ordered from most to least impactful:</h3>
                <h3><b>1.</b> Quality of research: The position paper demonstrates both depth and breadth in research, including explicit references to credible sources, UN speeches, and/or UN resolutions.</h3>
                <h3><b>2.</b> Quality of ideas: The position paper provides multiple well-thought out solutions to the problem that are practical, efficient, and take into account the country’s position on the issue.</h3>
                <h3><b>3.</b> Completeness and Variety of research: The position paper provides ample coverage of the topic, prior UN action, and the delegate's country’s experience with the issue.</h3>
                <h3><b>4.</b> Organization and Writing: The position paper is concise and organized in a logical and easy to read manner.</h3>

                <h2>Basic Requirements for all position papers:</h2>

                <h3>- explicit references to UN speeches or resolutions (ex: in Resolution…)</h3>

                <h3>There are no organizational requirements for your position paper. However, we suggest that you follow the:</h3>
                <h2>4 Paragraph System </h2>
                <h3><b>1st Paragraph – Topic Background:</b> Provide an overview of the issue at hand. Begin with some sort of hook or introduction. Depending on the topic, you should provide a brief history of the issue, which nations or groups are responsible, and how it has developed overtime. Be sure to analyze how the issue is affecting the world today, and who is being most effected. Break your topic into subtopics and explain which of these subtopics are the most important. This paragraph should be objective and not specific to your country.</h3>
                <h3><b>2nd Paragraph – Past International Action: </b>Outline previous action taken by your committee to address the issue. For UN committees, it is particularly strong to reference previous UN resolutions or UN speeches. You need not limit yourself to your committee's past actions; if other international organizations such as other UN committees or regional bodies took important actions on the topic, feel free to include these as well.</h3>
                <h3><b>3rd Paragraph – Country Policy:</b> Describe your country’s position on the issue. This includes how your country has been effected, actions taken by your country to address the issue, and statements made by your government regarding the topic. Remember to only provide your country’s perspective and not your own, even if you disagree with your country’s position. If your country does not have a strong opinion or stake in the issue, base your position upon that of your closest allies.</h3>
                <h3><b>4th Paragraph - Solutions:</b> This is the most important paragraph. Suggest one or more possible solutions to the issue. You should write this section last, taking into account all that you have learned from the previous three sections. Explain how your solution will address the subtopics you provided in your first paragraph. Make sure that your solutions do not simply repeat previous UN actions but instead provide a new approach that will efficiently solve major aspects of the problem. Be sure to take into account cost, time, personnel requirements, and the jurisdiction of your committee (ie: the power that your committee has to act). Most importantly, your solution must align with the position of your country and your close allies.</h3>

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <h3><b>1. Be concise:</b> Longer is not always better when it comes to writing position papers. Rather than simply summarizing each of your sources, chose the most important information from each source and weave it into a cohesive paper. Remember that you are limited to one page per topic.</h3>
                <h3><b>2. Focus on solutions:</b> One of the most important parts of your position paper is the possible solutions for the topic. Make sure that your solutions are practical and successfully address important aspects of the issue at hand. Your solutions must align with the position of your country. Furthermore, your solution should be new and unique, not something that the UN has previously implemented.</h3>
                <h3><b>3. Follow the 4 paragraph system: </b>although it is not required, we suggest that you follow the 4 paragraph system described above. This will insure that you address the 4 required points, those being general background on the topic, past international action, your country’s position, and your solutions.</h3>
                <h3><b>4. Find credible sources:</b> when researching controversial world issues, you will most likely find a lot of outdated and biased information. Be sure to balance your research with a variety of sources to get an objective view of the issue. To learn your nation's position, try viewing your nation's official website or previous legislative action made by your government.</h3>
                <h3><b>5. Use explicit references: </b>Although they are not required, explicit references can increase the legitimacy of your paper. For the biggest impact, provide a meaningful quote or statistic from a credible source directly followed by the source in parenthesis. While references to credible websites are permissible, direct quotes from previous UN resolutions or statements by your country's government are usually the most effective. You must cite any explicit references in a bibliography at the end of your position paper.</h3>
                <h3><b>6. Comment on references:</b> A position paper is more than just a collection of credible quotes. More important than an explicit reference itself is the way that you use that reference to support your ideas. After every explicit reference, provide commentary explaining the importance of the quote, how it applies to the topic at hand, how it demonstrates your overall argument, etc.</h3>
                <h3><b>7. Provide complete solutions:</b> For your suggested solutions, be sure to include the following information: impact – what your solution will do, action – how your committee will implement your solution, and funding – how your committee will obtain the money to implement your solution.</h3>
                <h3><b>8. Determine subtopics:</b> Every topic can be subdivided into multiple subtopics each encapsulating a particular aspect of the issue at hand. For example, for the topic of food shortages in Africa, a few subtopics could include drought, unsustainable farming practices, food distribution, the effect of war on food production, and GMOs. Expand upon the key subtopics in your first paragraph and explain how your solutions will address each of these in the final paragraph. In many cases, you may have a specific solution for each individual subtopic.</h3>
                <h3><b>9. Use power searches:</b> Most search engines including Bing and Google have a power search ability which greatly streamlines the research process. If you enter “site: (sitename).(extension) + (search term)”, the search engine will only return results containing the site name and extension that you entered. For example, if you searched “site: un.org + food security”, the search engine would return webpages from un.org pertaining to food security. Other examples include: “site: .gov + (search term)” to return only sites with the .gov extension, or “site: (country extension) + (search term)” to only return sites in your country. For example, if you wanted to research the UK, enter “site: .uk + (search term)” to receive only websites based in the UK.</h3>
                <h3><b>10. Reference UN resolutions:</b> <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/ods">http://www.un.org/en/documents/ods</a> is a database containing nearly all resolutions passed by the UN. Use the search bar to find past UN resolutions pertaining to your topic. Explicitly reference these resolutions in your past international action paragraph. This is also a great way to ensure that the solutions that you suggest have not already been taken implemented. </h3>
