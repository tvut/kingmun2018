                    KINGMUN 2018 will be hosted by Lake Washington High School. LW offers an ideal central location for
                    many high school Model UNs in the King County area. As a school of over 1,400 students, the
                    facilities can easily accommodate this conference, including all committee spaces and a large auditorium.
                    It is less than a 15 minute walk from downtown Kirkland, so delegates will be able to easily find a
                    variety of food options during the 90 minute lunch breaks.

                <h2>Parking</h2>
                <h3 class="no-indent">
                    Unfortunately, there will be no parking at all Saturday at Lake Washington High School. The city will be hosting a recycling event
                    in the parking lot that uses all the spots: Delegates are encouraged to carpool, bike, or walk to the conference as possible (we will have access to the
                    drop off loop in front of the school) While we can not promise any parking nearby, there will be limited spots in and around the high school on the surrounding streets. For Sunday, there will be ample parking at Lake Washington itself.
                </h3>
                <h3 class="no-indent">
                    For parking on Saturday there are two nearby park and rides, the Houghton Park and Ride <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1fFbPpG5PNQ2" >(7024 116th Ave NE, Kirkland, WA 98033)</a> and the Kirkland Way Park and Ride <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DLBvfmxRGjA2">(11255 Kirkland Way, Kirkland, WA 98033)</a> . Both are about a ten minutes walk from Lake Washington High School. Please note if you park in the Kirkland Way Park and Ride you have to take the walkway to the right of the southbound entrance and then the bridge over.

                independent delegates.</h3>
            <h2>Must I register through my school, or can I register individually?</h2>
            <h3>All delegates must register via their school’s MUN club to be admitted to KINGMUN if their school's MUN
                club is in attendance. Each club’s advisor or head delegate should register their delegation. Then, each
                MUN club will receive country assignments for its entire delegation. Those who do not have a club or
                who’s club is not attending KINGMUN may register independently but must have a chaperone. These cases
                will be handled on a individual basis so email <a href="mailto:sg@kingmun.org">sg@kingmun.org</a> if
                this topic pertains to you.</h3>
            <h2>What committees are available?</h2>

            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <h3>No refunds will be given unless the conference does not occur or the cancellation arises from medical
                issues, force majeure, or other circumstances arising beyond reasonable control. These cases will be
                reviewed on an individual basis.</h3>
            <h2>Technology Policy</h2>
            <h3>Technology is a unique and integral part of KINGMUN. At the beginning of the conference, all delegates
                will receive USB storage drives containing, among other items, committee-specific documents (background
                guides, position papers, crisis items), Rules of Procedure specifications, and the Delegate Handbook. In
                order to fully experience KINGMUN, delegates are <b>strongly urged</b> to bring personal computing
                devices capable of accessing the storage drive. In the event that a delegate cannot use the storage
                drive, hard copies will be provided.</h3>
            <h3>The use of phones is not permitted during committee session. The use of other internet-connected devices
                is permitted during informal debate (moderated and unmoderated caucuses) <b>only</b>.</h3>
            <h3>If a dais member feels that a delegate is abusing the right to use an electronic device, the dais member
                will issue a warning to the delegate. If such activity persists, the incident will be reported to a
                Secretariat member, who will take corrective action including, but not limited to, restricting the
                offending delegate’s usage of electronic devices. If further issues arise, the adviser responsible for
                the delegate will be contacted.</h3>
            <h2>Rooming Policy</h2>
            <h3>Unfortunately, KINGMUN is not able to offer any rooming for Saturday night. This also means that KINGMUN
                claims no responsibility, legal or otherwise, for the whereabouts or activities of KINGMUN delegates
                in-between committee sessions.</h3>
