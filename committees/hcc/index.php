            <h3>The Historical Crisis Committee (HCC) is an advanced committee characterized by innovative solutions and fast-based debate. A challenging committee, the HCC will force delegates to actively learn and act based on historical events. Additionally, this rewarding experience will encourage delegates to rethink the past and forget (only partially) about reality. </h3>
            <h3>As a crisis committee, the HCC will follow a different set of rules of procedure. Instead of passing resolutions, solutions will come from directives which allow delegates to act as individuals. In this committee, history comes to life, and you have the power to change it.</h3>
            <h2 style="text-align:left">Topic:</h2>
            <h3>It’s 1991, tensions in the region of Yugoslavia have been building. After WWI, the region had been consolidated in the Yugoslav State. Following WWII, the Communist Leader Josip Broz Tito took control and established the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia(SFR), a strong centralized Communist State consisting of six socialist republics and two autonomous provinces, each with a vote. Although suppressed under Authoritarian leadership, the varying ethnicities and religions within these regions still existed and starting in 1965 were even allowed more freedoms than would be allowed in the Soviet Union. Namely, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Muslim populations existed to different degrees in each Republic. The differences began to show in 1980 after the death of their charismatic, unifying leader, Tito.
            </h3>
            <h3>Additionally, after the start of the fall of the Soviet Union, which the SFR largely mimicked, confidence in the Socialist State began to deteriorate. Nationalism and talks of independence began to flourish in certain regions, especially Slovenia and Croatia, while large portions of the population still maintained loyalty to a united Yugoslavia. Their interests are represented by Yugoslav’s People’s Army.
            </h3>
            <h3>By 1991 tensions have reached a climax. Serbia has consolidated four of the eight the votes within Socialist Federal Republic of Party of Yugoslavia (the long standing ruling party) by replacing their representatives. At the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Serbia blocked most of the demands of Slovenia and Croatia, leading them to walk out of the room, and on January 25, 1991, Slovenia declared independence.
            </h3>
            <h3>Now as a delegatee you are stuck with a bundle of Republics, each with populations seeking independence and those still loyal to a larger Communist State. Complicated ethnic situations play a role, and it’s your job to muck through all the  different interests and find out how to best represent your own agenda.

                        <h4 class="bio">Annalisa Mueller-Eberstein attends the International Community School in Kirkland. During her three years of MUN, beginning in eighth grade with KINGMUN 2016, she has enjoyed her time as a delegate and served as the Assistant Director of DISEC and the US Senate as well as the Chair for the UNEP, and Director of UNODC and WHO. One of her favorite things about MUN besides FUNMUN is the debate in and out of committee as well as the bonding between fellow delegates and conference attendees. Only problem is that she can only remember them by country name. Annalisa can't wait to meet you all at KINGMUN 2018 and listen to all the exciting debate right after she finishes binge watching a certain show on Netflix, a project for FBLA, her duties as PR Officer of ASB, or most importantly, making bad puns.
