            <h3>The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was established in 2006 as part of the United Nations intergovernmental body system. The UNHRC is responsible for strengthening and protecting human rights all over the world. Member states are elected by the General Assembly, and seats are distributed between regions. </h3>
            <h3>The UNHRC provides solvency to a wide range of issues ranging from women’s rights to freedom of expression. The elected nations work to identify and highlight various rights violations and lead research and advocacy activities in response. Delegates will be responsible for taking various stances on controversial topics and coming together to resolve critical human rights violations.The UNHRC is excited to see progressive dialogue and innovative ideas towards a comprehensive solution to the current human rights violations occurring. </h3>
            <h2 style="text-align:left">Topic 1: Addressing the environmental human rights violations that come with urbanization</h2>
            <h3>As cities grow exponentially, their infrastructure continues to lag behind. The UNHRC is a vital actor in ensuring people’s right to an adequate standard of living, whether in regards to air quality, water and sanitation, or housing.
            </h3>
            <h3>With the intensive industrialization that comes with urbanization, the environment faces major degradation. With rapidly rising CO2 emissions, global warming intensifies as well. Environmental problems are magnified in denser cities that are not putting attention to water source management and land cleanup. The UNHRC is an essential actor in devising solutions that will bilaterally address both the fixation of the existing issues, and the future preservation of the environment. As industrialization pushes people into cities, satisfactory housing becomes harder and harder to acquire. With the ever increasing population, there is not enough housing, therefore we are seeing the homeless population becoming greater in magnitude. In addition, 	there is a greater threat to minority culture from new developments in cities. </h3>
            <h3>Even in crowded urban areas, an adequate standard of living is a human right, and the UNHRC must do everything it can to protect it.</h3>
            <h2 style="text-align: left">Topic 2: Confronting the factors that contribute to discrimination against women in developing countries
            </h2>
            <h3>While gender discrimination remains an ongoing issue worldwide, it is particularly magnified in developing nations. Leaders continue to dismiss women’s rights in the workplace, and women continue to suffer from acts of violence with limited access to justice. Gender-based discrimination limits numerous opportunities for women, and leads to long hours of labor under inhumane working conditions. Despite their crucial role in caring for their home and family, women in developing nations are among the most exploited and abused workers in the world, facing debt labor and human trafficking.</h3>
            <h3>Beyond the financial discrepancies and unjust labor conditions, many women face a far more atrocious struggle. Various acts of domestic violence continue to plague nations including Cambodia and Bangladesh and has become normalized in today’s culture. Without immediate action from the UNHRC, these heinous violations of women’s rights will further grow at alarming rates.  Women cannot be empowered until member-states develop conceivable solutions to end their prolonged suffering.  </h3>

                        <h4 class="bio">Lauren is a senior at Peninsula High School and is ecstatic to serve as the Director of the UNHRC. She founded the Model UN club at her high school junior year, and has a few awards under her belt. In addition, she has staffed both PACMUN and BELLARMUN. Lauren is fascinated with the world of Model UN because her passions lie in the world of public speaking and international affairs, and the format of MUN allows her to, as Hannah Montana would word it, “have the best of both worlds.” Outside of MUN, Lauren is the captain of the Speech and Debate team, volunteers at her local food bank, is a leader in environmental club and UNICEF, and plays tennis. Lauren is looking forward to meeting all delegates and wishes good luck to all at KINGMUN 2018!

KINGMUN 2017 will be her first time staffing after attending numerous conferences in her first couple years. When not immersed in intense international debate, you can find her passed out on the couch, drowning in the swimming pool, or volunteering through Key Club. She loves the diplomatic and collaborative aspect of MUN and is excited to bring her enthusiasm to the UNHRC!
