            <h3>In an age of rapidly developing space programs worldwide, UNOOSA has taken a global role in moderating peaceful exploration and international collaboration in outer space, especially by promoting sustainable development and use of space-related technologies. Working with other UN bodies and political leaders, UNOOSA strives to develop efficient, nationwide space programs for its member states. The committee currently has 83 member states and is located at the United Nations Office at Vienna, Austria. With the state of international law and cooperation dependent on the actions of UNOOSA, it is critical that delegates are aware of their country positions and current events, especially as related to space policies and technology.</h3>
            <h2 style="text-align:left">Topic 1: Colonization of Space</h2>
            <h3>With the rapid development of space technologies, coupled with global population booms and increasing resource scarcity, colonizing celestial bodies such as the moon and Mars, has never seemed more appealing -- or feasible. As such, many governments and private companies have set their sights on extraterrestrial colonization, while others remain vehemently opposed to it. The human tendency to colonize and settle unexplored territories is patterned throughout history, yet little precedent exists to effectively prevent wars and ensure colonization is peaceful. Thus, as settling the moon and Mars becomes more of a reality, extensive policies and globally recognized laws must be implemented to avoid conflict and ensure space colonies run peacefully. The issue of space colonization is multi-faceted, and will not be easily resolved. Nations and corporations must consider not only the financial and logistical aspects of colonization, but moral and political ones as well. Who will pay for colonies? Will astronauts be given the same rights in space as their home states? What laws apply to Martian or moon-born individuals, and how are they to be regulated? How do we avoid repeating our past mistakes on earth? To answer such questions, and many more, one must think in the theoretical, and use the past to determine the future.
            </h3>
            <h2 style="text-align: left">Topic 2: Mining of Materials in Space</h2>
            <h3>In an urbanizing world, the demand for resources, especially precious metals, is growing significantly. With the subsequent depletion of these resources on Earth, the availability of them in asteroids is becoming prevalent to the international community. Parallels from the early Space Age are arising and countries and industries alike are setting aside efforts in preparation to mine and exploit these asteroids. However, while technologies are rapidly being developed, the ethics and environmental costs as a result of space mining are left undiscussed. Another concern lies with the political hostility that may be provoked as a result of laying claims on spatial objects. Ultimately, this highlights the need for the UNOOSA to decide how the international community should approach such initiatives, as these standards will determine the future of space mining as a whole.

                        <h4 class="bio">Angelus, also often known as Angie, is incredibly excited to work with the amazing staff and delegates of KINGMUN as the Director of the UNOOSA! She is a senior at Woodinville High School in Washington, and besides attending, staffing, or serving on the secretariat of conferences up and down the West Coast, she fills her days with photography, German culture, and singing. Her hobbies also include hiking, dancing (badly), and teaching her class of kindergarteners how to ski. In the future, she hopes to somehow combine biochemistry and computer science in some kind of “Black Mirror”-esque career and also travel into outer space.  UNOOSA has been a dream committee for Angelus to lead and she looks forward to seeing the growth and diverse solutions that its delegates will achieve!</h4></div>

                        <h4 class="bio">As a junior attending the International Community School, Ciara Gormley has been active in the MUN community since her freshman year, having attended several conferences along the west coast. KINGMUN remains one of her favorite MUN conferences due to its tight community, quality, and range of committees for every level of debate, and she’s thrilled to be staffing it this year. She hopes to utilize her MUN experience as a delegate and inner space nerd to help create a committee that will challenge and excite each delegate. In her free time, Ciara enjoys rock climbing, playing the piano, purchasing overpriced tea, and reading random Wikipedia articles. Ciara is extremely excited to be assistant director for UNOOSA during KINGMUN 2018!

Passionate about international affairs, linguistics, and the intimidating aspect of deep space, Audri is also a reporter for her school newspaper. When not busy with IB, she can be found playing either guitar or piano, or trying to debug a coding project. Audri is very excited to serve as your chair for this upcoming committee and looks forward to working with all of you!
