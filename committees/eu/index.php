            <h3>Rising from the ashes of the second World War, the European Union (EU) began as a purely economic union
                between six european countries. Since then, it has grown in size, and expanded its focus to a wide range
                of international issues. Currently appraised of 28 member states, the EU is a regional committee,
                concerned with preserving the economic and political security of its citizens. The committee
                concentrates on areas spanning climate, environment, culture, innovation, and security.</h3>
            <h3>This unique committee focuses on promoting the core European values of tolerance, justice, freedom,
                dignity, equality, and democracy. Ranging from beginner to advanced delegates, the EU is the leader for
                innovation and growth in the eastern hemisphere. </h3>
            <h2 style="text-align:left">Topic 1: Combating Environmental Pollution</h2>
            <h3>Ecological toxicity comes in many forms, including chemical waste in freshwater resources and unhealthy air quality levels. Ensuring environmental stability is the seventh of the United Nations’ eight Millennium Development Goals and currently stands as one of the EU’s top priorities. Air, water and chemical pollution are detrimental to sustainable development, and with the global population estimated to increase to nine billion by 2030, it is essential to eliminate the primary factors that contribute to gravity of the issue. Human influence and the sudden increase in factory production releases toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Chemicals and poor water quality have been linked to a plethora of diseases and is the leading cause of increasing child mortality rates in Europe. Air pollution alone is the cause of 467,000 premature deaths annually. Individuals that ingest these chemicals face risk of respiratory disease. Social, political, and economic complications can be held accountable for the stark rise in numbers in recent years. Holding some of the world’s highest environmental standards in the world, the EU has already established various frameworks and regulations in attempt to combat this issue, however, ecological toxicity remains one of Europe’s pressing issues, and will only increase in magnitude if not addressed effectively.
            </h3>
            <h2 style="text-align: left">Topic 2: Single Monetary Union</h2>
            <h3>Though one of the European Union’s main areas of focus is economics, there exists an ongoing debate over the Eurozone’s Single Monetary Policy. The shared monetary policy between Euro Area members is meant to promote integration of nations’ economies as well as increase confidence in the international economy. Having a single, shared currency eliminates exchange rates and costs and makes it easier for companies to trade throughout the Union, but countries have to meet certain criteria to enter the Eurozone.  However, by adopting the Euro, nations give up a significant amount of their national authority and independence over their economies. Some countries are extremely sensitive to exchange rates and other countries that currently are in large economic declines would be taking large risks by adopting the Euro. With about two thirds of EU member states sharing a currency, the Euro Area is the only international economic monetary union and is predicted to continue expanding. The economic and political effects of a single monetary policy is now an international matter becoming more prevalent to European nations.
