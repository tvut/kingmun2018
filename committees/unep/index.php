            <h3>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is a UN agency specifically responsible for coordinating various environmental activities and policies, primarily focusing on: climate change, disasters and conflicts, ecosystem management, environmental governance, chemicals and waste, resource efficiency, and environment under review.  Founded in 1972 after the United Nations Conference of the Human Environment; the UNEP works with other environmental institutions, local governments, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The committee is currently composed of 193 member states. The agency’s headquarters are set in Nairobi, Kenya, with six regional offices and numerous other country offices. Regardless of the issue at hand, the UNEP continuously strives to uphold their commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship. As this committee combats issues that are presently globally relevant, it is pertinent that delegates keep up on current events, and understand their implications on the committee. It should be noted that even though the UNEP discusses climate change, it is not the main focus of the committee; however, delegates may find its impacts relevant to discussion.

            <h2 style="text-align:left">Topic 1: Mercury</h2>
            <h3>The eightieth element, designated by Hg, has posed an ever increasing danger to human populations as well as the environment as it has become ever more present. Mercury is a neurotoxin, which harms developing nervous systems, as well as poses other internal and external issues to the human body. Mercury is put into the environment largely through the free burning of coal as well as the improper burning and disposal of consumer products. This contributes to the release of mercury into the atmosphere and ocean, thus causing land and groundwater pollution. In ecosystems the problems of bioaccumulation and biomagnification are prevalent, especially observable and relevant in fish populations. The extension of mercury into food webs can contribute to destabilization and collapse of ecosystems. The issues of regulation and pollution prevention surrounding mercury are essential in preventing and mitigating environmental, ecological, and human health damages.

            <h2 style="text-align: left">Topic 2: Preserving Biodiversity</h2>
            <h3>Biodiversity is the presence of variation among different forms of life within an ecosystem. This essential presence has been experiencing drastic decline. Preserving biodiversity is crucial to the resilience of ecosystems. In many of the delicate, diminishing, ecosystems today, such as coral reefs and tropical forests, this worsens the already rapid rate of species loss and ecosystem collapse. A loss of biodiversity would also mean a loss in potential resources. Many chemicals and genetics lie yet undiscovered in in the world's ecosystems, which could be valuable for producing new pharmaceuticals or consumer products. Over the long term, a decrease in biodiversity, coupled with climate change, will shift the earth's biomes and individual ecosystems, altering the distribution of all forms of life: plants, pathogens, and animals, including humans. The viability of the exploitation of earth's ecosystems resources will need to be reconsidered, and revised in order to limit the harmful losses of unpreserved biodiversity. </h3>
