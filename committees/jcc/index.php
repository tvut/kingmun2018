            <h3>JCC is not for the faint hearted. The JCC is a unique committee experience. It engages its delegates in impromptu experiences based vaguely on fact but more firmly in fiction. It consists of two opposing blocs running alongside each other to come to a consensus with expansive issues. Addressing one ceaseless problem, delegates will solve problems that arise with a variety of different and radical actions. JCC requires constant attention, ceaseless diligence and delegates that both look at the bigger picture and think critically. Creativity and public speaking skills are essential for success.  Prepare for betrayal, violence, and failure by having the mindset to overcome them.

            <h3>May 1995, the Chinese government kidnaps the Panchen Lama, the second most important spiritual figure in Tibetan culture. Years later, the Dalai Lama dies and unrest erupts in Tibet for the Chinese government releases the Panchen Lama who then selects a pro-Chinese Tibetan aristocrat as the new Dalai Lama. Protesters flood the streets lambasting the Chinese government and denouncing the new Dalai Lama as illegitimate. Soon, protests turn violent as extremists attack the Chinese forces in Tibet. As time passes, nationalist forces begin to band together to achieve independence against the Chinese government. Inspired by Tibet’s attempts, the autonomous region of Xinjiang begins to fight for independence and bands together with Tibet to create a coalition to fight the Chinese government. </h3>

In school, Savannah is excited to be working towards her Associates in Business degree, which she will get when she graduates High School.
