KINGMUN has had a special place in her heart since she organized her delegation’s attendance at it in her sophomore year, and Megan cannot express how fond she is of this conference and its secretariat. She is enormously excited for this conference, and she hopes that you love KINGMUN just as much as she does.</h4>

The thrill of debate and the suspenseful hours working on resolutions are some of the many reasons why Sherveen is passionate for Model UN. Besides MUN, Sherveen finds interests in other activities such as playing basketball, exploring the world of computers, and breaking down complex trig functions. At school Sherveen is the president of the A/V club and is the secretary of his ASB. By being your USG of Marketing, Sherveen is more than ready to give it his all to make all delegates have an amazing time and experience at KINGMUN 2018!</h4>

He fell in love with MUN and went on to participate in over six conferences during his Freshman year. His favorite part of MUN is writing resolutions because it is also the end goal of the United Nations and demonstrates the accomplishments that all the delegates worked hard to achieve. Outside of Model UN, he can be found taking photographs, playing video games or doing robotics. He can’t wait to make KINGMUN 2018 the best one yet!</h4>

The dedication of delegates, advisors, and staff to the values of MUN has consistently amazed her, and she enjoys meeting new delegates who are as blown away with MUN as she was at her very first conference. When she’s not running from library to library for MUN events, you’ll find Shawdi (attempting to) play tennis, drawing, toying with calculus problems, or searching for the nearest piano. As your USG of Logistics, Shawdi hopes to provide delegates with another fun opportunity to question and change the world! </h4>

KINGMUN 2017 was Mark’s first staffing experience and he’s glad to be back, this time as USG of Committees. Any free time not devoted to MUN or school is usually spent playing table tennis or competing in random video games.

She believes you haven’t truly lived until it’s 3 A.M. and you’re writing a resolution, running on nothing but coffee.  There is nothing she would rather be doing than Model UN, but if forced, you would find her studying, playing with her dog, or hanging out with her friends. KINGMUN 2017 was Zoe’s first time staffing, and she can’t wait to help this year’s staff. She’s very excited for KINGMUN, and wants to make it the best one yet! </h4>

                <h3>KINGMUN was born on a train—the train ride back from VMUN 2014, to be precise. At this time, the MUN circuit in Washington was limited to WASMUN and VIKMUN, both college-run conferences. As a small group of sophomores at ICS, the future KINGMUN secretariat felt that there was little that we could do to improve the MUN offerings, yet, having just witnessed the success of VMUN 2014, they realized that they too could have the power to offer their own conference to the Washington MUN community.</h3>
                    <h3>However, it appeared that they were not alone, as that summer, Bellarmine high school announced PACMUN 2014. PACMUN would go on to become the first high school-run conference in Washington and soon grow to rival even VMUN, holding the title as both the largest and only overnight conference in Washington.</h3>
                    <h3>Although all of the original KINGMUN founders eagerly joined the PACMUN family, the future KINGMUN secretariat still held on to the hopes of one day running a conference of their own. Clearly, the need for high quality, professional MUN conferences had been filled, yet this gave them the freedom to offer something even more exciting: a new way of experiencing MUN.</h3>
                    <h3>The soon to be secretary general saw MUN as a way to develop the people skills that high school curriculums often fail to teach in a simultaneously challenging and supportive environment. However, after attending several conferences, he began to see that certain elements of MUN can detract from this ideal. Rigid adherence to parliamentary procedure often stifled the flow of ideas, non-divisive topics resulted in competitive agreement rather than true debate, reuse of common topics reduced the excitement for returning delegates, and a preoccupation with rewards undermined the very purpose of MUN. He firmly believed in the merits of the traditional MUN experience, but began to wonder if tweaking this experience could provide other, equally important benefits.</h3>
                    <h3>With this goal in mind, they branched out from ICS, incorporating Lake Washington and Interlake into the core secretariat group. Together, they crafted our ideas into a single cohesive plan to offer an experimental MUN conference that prioritized excitement, fun, and liveliness of debate over all else. They experimented with concepts completely new to the MUN field, such as providing delegates with personalized USBs containing documents and secrets that would aid them throughout the conference. They developed unique and divisive topics including everything from a reenactment of the 1919 Bolshevik Revolution to crises of the twenty-second century. They gave directors complete freedom to shape their committees and parliamentary procedure to maximize fun and dynamic debate.</h3>
                    <h3>Their goal was to offer a new and unprecedented MUN experience that sought not to compete with the established conferences, but instead complement them with a new way of experiencing MUN.</h3>
